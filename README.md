# Meshtastic Client + Relayer (NOTE FOR REVIEWERS)

im gonna say it once again here too and i hope you guys read the journal but missed it, on the latest journal entry i left a entry with a heading ***"NOTE FOR REVIEWERS"*** (third time adding the same entry because Reviewers didnt read it before)

i had said it there that there is ***NO GITHUB and YOUTUBE DEMO ATTATCHED*** as its a totally ***HARDWARE RELATED PROJECT WITH PREBUILT COMPONENTS USED AND NO CUSTOM PCBS ARE USED***

i used the firmeware for the devices from https://meshtastic.org

the ***reason*** for no youtube link attached is that you can ***Already see the client devices working*** and the relayer only works on ***long ranges*** and i would need to go far away to show a video of the relayer working.

i hope there is nothing else needed to clarify as i have ***EXPLAINED IN THE JOURNAL*** on how it works and the circuitry used.

Thankyou for YOUR attention.
